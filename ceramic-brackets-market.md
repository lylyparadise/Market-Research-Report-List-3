<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Brackets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Ligating</li><li>Conventional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic brackets are available in two main types: self-ligating and conventional. Self-ligating brackets do not require elastic or metal ligatures to hold the archwire in place, leading to less friction and potentially faster treatment times. Conventional brackets, on the other hand, use ligatures to secure the wire, offering more control over tooth movement. Both types of brackets are popular choices for orthodontic treatment, with self-ligating brackets being favored for their efficiency and lower maintenance, while conventional brackets are known for their precise control.</p></p>
