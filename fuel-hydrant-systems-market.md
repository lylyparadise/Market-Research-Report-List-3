<p><strong>The Fuel Hydrant Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonprimary Airports (<10,000 Passenger Boardings/year)</li><li>Primary Airports (>10,000 Passenger Boardings/year)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fuel hydrant systems are widely used in airports to efficiently fuel aircraft. Nonprimary airports with less than 10,000 passenger boardings per year may opt for smaller and more cost-effective fuel hydrant systems due to lower traffic volume. In contrast, primary airports with over 10,000 passenger boardings per year require larger and more robust fuel hydrant systems to accommodate the higher volume of aircraft and fueling demands. Both types of airports benefit from the convenience and efficiency of fuel hydrant systems.</p></p>
