<p><strong>The Axial Bone Densitometry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)</li><li>Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial bone densitometry is a method used to measure bone density in specific areas of the body, such as the spine or hip. There are two main types of axial bone densitometry: Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). DEXA is the most commonly used method and involves using low-dose X-rays to measure bone mineral density. QCT, on the other hand, uses computed tomography scans to assess bone density in a three-dimensional manner, providing more detailed information compared to DEXA.</p></p>
