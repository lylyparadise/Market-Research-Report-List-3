<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flangedless Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft Seal Valve</li><li>Hard Seal Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flangeless butterfly valves are categorized into two main types based on the seal mechanism: Soft seal valves and hard seal valves. Soft seal valves use a resilient material, such as rubber or PTFE, to create a tight seal between the disc and the seat, offering reliable performance for moderate pressure and temperature conditions. On the other hand, hard seal valves employ metal-to-metal contact between the disc and seat, providing superior sealing for high-pressure and high-temperature applications. Both types offer unique advantages depending on the specific operational requirements.</p></p>
