<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gray Hydrogen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Gas Reforming</li><li>Coal Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gray hydrogen is produced through natural gas reforming, where methane from natural gas is converted into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This process is the most common and cost-effective method of hydrogen production. On the other hand, gray hydrogen can also be produced through coal processing, where coal is gasified to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Both natural gas reforming and coal processing markets are key contributors to the gray hydrogen market, providing a significant portion of the world's hydrogen supply.</p></p>
