<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardants Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-halogenated Flame Retardants</li><li>Halogenated Flame Retardants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant chemicals are categorized into two main types: non-halogenated and halogenated. Non-halogenated flame retardants are considered environmentally friendly as they do not contain any halogen elements like chlorine or bromine. They work by releasing water or carbon dioxide when exposed to fire, thus reducing the flammability of materials. On the other hand, halogenated flame retardants contain halogen elements and are known for their high effectiveness in preventing ignition and combustion of materials. However, they have raised concerns due to their potential environmental and health impacts.</p></p>
