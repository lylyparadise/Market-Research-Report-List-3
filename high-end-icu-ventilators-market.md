<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Invasive ventilation in high-end ICU ventilators involves inserting a tube into the patient's airway to assist with breathing. This type of ventilation is typically used for patients who are unable to breathe on their own. On the other hand, non-invasive ventilation does not require a tube to be inserted and instead delivers air through a mask. This method is often used for patients who can still breathe adequately on their own but need additional support. Both types of ventilation play a crucial role in managing critically ill patients in the ICU.</p></p>
