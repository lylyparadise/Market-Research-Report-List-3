<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresist remover is a crucial component in the semiconductor industry for the precise removal of photoresist materials after the patterning process. There are two main types of photoresist removers: positive type and negative type. Positive type removers are designed to dissolve and remove the exposed portions of photoresist, leaving the unexposed areas intact. On the other hand, negative type removers work by dissolving the unexposed portions of the photoresist, while leaving the exposed areas unaffected. Both types are essential for the efficient and precise fabrication of semiconductor devices.</p></p>
