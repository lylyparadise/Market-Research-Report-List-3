<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corneal Topographers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacido-based Systems</li><li>Evaluation-based Systems</li><li>Interferometric Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Corneal topographers are devices used to create detailed maps of the cornea's surface. The market for corneal topographers is segmented into three main types: Pacido-based systems, which use a series of rings to measure the reflection of light on the cornea; evaluation-based systems, which analyze how light is reflected off the cornea in different patterns; and interferometric systems, which use interference patterns to measure the cornea's shape. Each system offers unique benefits and may be preferred for specific applications in ophthalmology.</p></p>
