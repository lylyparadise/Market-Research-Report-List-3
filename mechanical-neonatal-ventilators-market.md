<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical neonatal ventilators include both invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive ventilators involve inserting a tube into the infant's airway to deliver oxygen and assist with breathing. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support through a mask or nasal prongs without the need for intubation. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in providing respiratory support to newborns with breathing difficulties, helping to maintain adequate oxygen levels and support lung function.</p></p>
