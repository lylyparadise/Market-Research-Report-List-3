<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carrier Screening Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Molecular Screening Test</li><li>Biochemical Screening Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carrier screening is a type of genetic testing that can identify individuals who carry gene mutations associated with certain disorders. There are two main types of carrier screening tests - molecular screening tests and biochemical screening tests. Molecular screening tests analyze DNA for specific gene mutations, while biochemical screening tests measure the levels of certain proteins or enzymes that may indicate a genetic disorder. Both types of tests help identify carriers of genetic mutations that may be passed on to their children.</p></p>
