<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Corneal Curvature Instrument Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Helmholtz Type</li><li>Javal-Schiotz Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automatic Corneal Curvature Instrument market consists of two main types: the Helmholtz Type and the Javal-Schiotz Type. The Helmholtz Type uses a Placido disk or a laser to project rings onto the cornea, measuring the curvature based on the reflection pattern. On the other hand, the Javal-Schiotz Type measures the curvature by indenting the cornea with a small weight and observing the resulting deformation. Both types are used by eye care professionals to assess corneal curvature for the diagnosis and management of various eye conditions.</p></p>
