<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotating Torque Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-based sensing</li><li>Noncontact-based sensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotating torque sensors can be categorized into two main types: contact-based sensing and non-contact-based sensing. Contact-based sensing involves the use of physical contact between the sensor and the rotating object to measure torque. On the other hand, non-contact-based sensing utilizes technologies such as optical, magnetic, or capacitance to measure torque without direct contact. Each type of sensor has its own advantages and applications, depending on factors such as accuracy requirements, environmental conditions, and the type of rotating system being monitored.</p></p>
