<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Killer Cell Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NK Cell Therapies</li><li>NK Cell Directed Antibodies</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural Killer (NK) Cell Therapy is a type of immunotherapy that uses the patient's own immune cells to target and kill cancer cells. NK cell therapies involve isolating and expanding these specialized immune cells in the laboratory before re-infusing them back into the patient's body to enhance their cancer-fighting abilities. On the other hand, NK Cell Directed Antibodies are designed to specifically target and bind to markers on cancer cells, marking them for destruction by NK cells. Both therapies show promise in treating a variety of cancers.</p></p>
